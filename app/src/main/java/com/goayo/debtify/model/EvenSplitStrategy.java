 * 2020-10-12 Modified by Alex Phu and Yenan Wang: Changed RoundingMode from HALF_UP to HALF_EVEN.
 * 2020-10-13 Modified by Oscar Sanner: Changed the parameters of the function to become generic for IUserData.
 * It's now usable outside of the Model. Also returns a tuple with an ID and the total amount for the user.
 * 2020-10-13 Modified by Alex Phu: Changed to package private.
