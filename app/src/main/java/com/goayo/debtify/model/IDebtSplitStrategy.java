 * Strategy interface for splitting up debts.
 * Meant primarily to be used as a wrapper for model objects fetched from outside the model.

 * 2020-10-13 Modified by Oscar Sanner: Changed the parameters of the function to become generic for IUserData
 * It's now usable outside of the Model. Also returns a tuple with an ID and the total amount for the user.
