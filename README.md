Have you ever been in the situation where you've been dwelling on, "man if only we could go dutch for this lunch, my csn is already running out".

Here's why you should use the app Debtify:
* Your time should be focused on creating everlasting experiences, not spending time on irrelevant math.
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like dividing debts from scratch.

Of course, we know there are people who like to skew the math during debt splits but do not fret. An option to change the ratio of the debt is implemented for you guys!
